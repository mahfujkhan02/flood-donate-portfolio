               <h2>Education For a family</h2>
               
               <p>Children need to be properly taught about the dangers of flooding, what to do, what not to do, and how to best keep themselves safe and alive. It should be explained to them in language that they understand, in a manner designed to educate and not simply frighten. In addition, adults should be proper role models when it comes to heeding the advice and warnings as issued by the National Weather Service and taking all appropriate safety measures.</p>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>Emergency shelters or transitional shelters are a common issue in the aftermath of disasters. Worldwide, millions of houses are damaged or destroyed by disasters every year. People are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge, sometimes for short time and sometimes for a protracted period based on the nature of the disaster and the extent of the damage done to the housing structures. With the varying levels of affordability of the affected population as well as the external assistance provided, the time for reconstruction of houses might take even months. Such delays sometimes lead to reluctant relocation of the affected communities. Yet, on the issue of livelihoods, some communities cannot avoid living in vulnerable locations, whereas economic constraints do not allow them to invest in stronger housing construction</p>

                <p>The importance of education cannot be overestimated, as it is the key to a bright and successful future. At the Ri'ayah Foundation, it is our firm belief that all children deserve a chance to get a quality education, as it is the best way for them to realize their true potential. Our focus is to provide children with the opportunity to learn and develop, so they can grow up to be an integral and healthy part of their communities.</p>
